What did you miss?
Idk, I didn't get my thing back. However, you told my I missed something, so I figure it was probably the failure to create a class constructor.

What could you have done to have been more successful?
I could have remembered to study or at least looked over my notes after we finished them.

If you were successful - what was it that you did that made you successful? 
I was semi-successful (I hope), and that I would attribute to my paying attention during the note-taking that we were doing.
