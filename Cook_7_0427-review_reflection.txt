The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events
(stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.
Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
CS makes you problem solve, build on knowledge. You can't just learn every possibility and know the answe every time. You have to experiment, and find
what works.

What should students learn from CS?
Students should learn to not be upset and give up when they don't succeed immediately. The whole point is to learn how to figure things out, and
that requires you to get stuck sometimes, to think and adapt to puzzle out a solution. It isn't all about who can remember the most facts, it is
about who can figure them out, work on it so they learn it on their own.
