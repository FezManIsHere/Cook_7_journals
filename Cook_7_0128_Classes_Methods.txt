What is this?:
public void render(GameContainer gc, StateBasedGame sbg, Graphics g)
throws SlickException {

It is a piece of code called render, that is responsible for drawing the graphics in your state-based game inside the gamecontainer.

Is it a class or method? How do you know?
It is a method. I know because it starts with public void, which classes do not ever start with.
