What are your tentative thoughts / plans for your art project?
I am considering either trying to recreate my processing art, or possibly just a random generating polygon-thing.

What might be methods you will use?
I might use a method that generates random numbers

How might you incorporate a for loop?
I might make something that has a line that uses my method, turns, uses my method, turns, so on, etc

How might you incorporate, if, else if, else?
I could use an if else for a timer that ends the program

What math might you use?
I might use random ints and time maths.
