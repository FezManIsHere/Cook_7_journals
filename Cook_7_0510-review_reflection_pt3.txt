Create a class for 'Hero'
The class should contain:
variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol

public class Hero {
        int x = 0;
	String name;
	String weapon;
	int y = 0;
	int z = 0;
	int health = 100;
	int score = 0;
	int dexterity = 20;
	int perception = 50;
	int level = 1;
	char symbol = '$';	

	Hero(String a, int b, int c, char d) {
		this.x = b;
		this.y = c;
		this.name = a;
		this.symbol = d;
	}
}

Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name
Hero me = new Hero("Carter", 5, 5, '^');

Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.
You initialize objects in the class you want to use them in, otherwise you might as well be referencing ints from the hero class anyways. The class
constructor is a template, again, to use in the class you want to USE it in, and the class Hero is supposed to be encapsulating everything needed
to MAKE it in the class you NEED it in.
