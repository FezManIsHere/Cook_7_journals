Your revised Slick project is due Friday [Monday if you do homework]
Do you have another level?
Not yet. I plan to make on with more enemies, but for now it is just the one.

Will your revisions be complete? Why? Why not?
Yes, because if I don't have time in class, I will be working on it all week at home and all weekend, if it is necessary.
