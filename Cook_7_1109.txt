Are you ready to begin coding your game?
No.

Why or why not?
Because I have not finished coming up with a story, not to mention that I haven't finished my .dot file.

What will be your biggest challenges?
Figuring out the best way to call upon previous questions.

Why? 
Because I am not familiar with how the methods for questions work precisly, and I am planning on making questions that go back to previous questions.
