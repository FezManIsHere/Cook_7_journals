Here is my first journal created using Kosole. Yesterday/the day before, 
we used Git commands to make a Github repository, got our directory up and
our first document created. We also took notes to make sure we could
 a. understand how it works, and
 b. be able to replicate it.

The commands we will need to use everyday to make our journal are: 

 cd (dir name),
 git init,
 pico (journalname),
 edit file 
 git add myfilename,
 git commit -m "This is my journal for (date)"
 git push -u origin master.
 
The last one sends the completed journal to GitHub.
 Some of the commands we used to set up our stuff yesterday were things like
 git config and git remote add origin (web address).
