Make a list of ten problems (e.g., FAQs) you have faced when adding orbs to your game.
Try to provide specific code examples
1. No enemies to kill
2. Enemies not showing up (after I added them)
3. Enemies don't have negative effects on the player
Player.health -= 10000; (before I had this line they would just disappear)
4. Orb doesn't move
5. Orb doesn't go away
magic8ball.setIsVisible(false); (that fixed it up)
6. Orb only kills one enemy
7. Enemies are too close
8. Orb hitbox doesn't match image
this.hitbox = new Rectangle (a, b, 32, 32); (set to 96 by 96 to be more accurate)
9. Orb doesn't stay in the game long enough
magic8ball.setTimeExists(25); (set it to 50 to add time)
10. Enemies don't respawn in the same positions after win or loss
