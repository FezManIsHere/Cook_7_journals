What slick game did you create?
I created a game that runs on a time limit, that has a very unique backstory.

What challenges did you solve?
The challenges involving broken blocked properties on tiled maps.

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back.
Did you? Why or why not?
No, because there was just so much that I could add...I hadn't finished going through the mental process that was designing my map.

Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not?
More or less...my game wasn't at all following the day-to-day plan, but by Friday I was able to produce a fairly functunal game. My slowness related
to finishing the main part and adding more touches, fixes, etc. is most highly attributable to my having to take more time to finish the tiled map/
sprite sheets. Other than that my game pretty much met the requirements, in my opinion.
