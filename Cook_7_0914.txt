How would you explain the importanct of organizing one's thoughts
and not proceeding in a haphazard manner?

I would explain to them  that you don't just start "teh codes," you
have to think about what you are actually going to do. Going at a
project without any direction often leads to mistakes that could
have been avoided often, yet now mean a restart. This whole thing could
have all been avoided if you had just taken the time to do some
pseudocode.

Today you will finish creating an image of your Processing art
overlaid with code.

Why?

Because it is cool to know the things you can do with code,
and showing our code helps others understand both how we did it and
how it works.
