Briefly describe what you could have done to successfully complete your game?
I did complete it...I managed to rush the compiling and uploading bit at the end of class on Friday and finish. To have finished earlier, I could have
figured out how to get the slick libraries working at home.

Describe your problem solving / trouble shooting process.
1. Read the errors
2. Decipher the errors
3. Ask Xiangyu if still can't work it out
4. If Xiangyu doesn't know, google it
5. If Google is being uncooperative, ask Daniel
6. If Daniel is busy or can't help, ask Mr. Davis
7. If he is busy or can't help, remove the bit I was experimenting with and move on
