How do you add an image to a slick game?
You instantiate it (declare and initialize it (when you initialize it, you give it the file path)).

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.] 
The image is drawn in init. It could be something like:
startimage.draw();
To assign it the file path, you say something along the lines of:
startimage = new Image("Slick/res/win.png");
And to declare it initially, you have to do:
public Image startimage;
