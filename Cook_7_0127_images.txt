How do you add an image to a slick game?
You add an image by calling the instance that you set from the Image class and pass it an image file.

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.] 
The image is drawn from given coordinates starting at the top left. In the code they are found when you draw them using their method, which has been
set when you initialize them. The code looks something like imagetype = new Image("res/imagename.extension")
