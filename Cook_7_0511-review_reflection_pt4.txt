Explain in your own words -- what happens with nested for loops?
E.g.,
	for (int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j <= board[1].length - 1; j++) { ....}

Basically, both loops have to run until their end goal is met. The inside one is run until its requirements are met, but since there is one outside
of it, the inside had to run exponentially until the outside one had finished. So in:
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	for (int f = 0; f < 10; f++) {
		System.out.println("Wow");
	}
}

Wow would be printed 10^10 times in order to complete it. The inside would be done the number of times it runs, to the exponent of the number of times
the outside one runs.
