The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous
journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced
the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
I was with the former. I vaugely realized what was going on, from both the journal and the slick game. This is helped by the fact that we have been
doing Ruby in Engineering, and it breifly covered 2D arrays.

Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization,
class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.
1. How is a 2 dimensional array different from a 1 dimensional array?
2. Why is it a good idea to have class constructors?
3. Where is the origin located on a 2D array if it is a plane?
4. What order do the x, y, and z value come in on a 3D array?
5. How might you declare an object made from a class constructor?
6. How would you draw out a coordinate plane defined by a 2D array?
7. How might it work for a 3D array?
8. How do you create classes that extend each other?
9. What process is involved the creation of random events in a game that is otherwise turn based?
10. How might you expand the map and only show a small portion at a time?
