We will have a test on Friday.
It will be about the notes from last week.
Are you ready? 
Yes, if it is multiple choice. If it isn't, I might have to study a bit to allow myself to know it well enough to answer SARs about things.

What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?
My name is Carter Cook and I'm awesome.

We will be revising our Slick game to:
1. Have multiple levels
2. Enemies
3. Traps (or something) with coordinates defined by an array.
4. Give and take damage
5. Score
6. Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?
I will have to get my array juices flowing and set up methods for damage and appearing/disappearing.

Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? 
If not be specific.
Yes...to an extent. I am prepeared in terms of knowing how to set things up, but how to implement them will take some time, if I am being honest.
