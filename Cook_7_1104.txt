What is a method?
A method is a seperate peice of code in which you can make a series of steps and name that code so that you can call that code later instead of having
to re-type it all the time.

Which methods did you use and how did you use them in your guessing game program?
I used getGuess to ask for numbers, genNum to get the starting number, playGame for the code to just have the game without restarting, and checkNumber
to verify the guessed number against the real one.

What is a while loop?
A while loop is something that allows you to do something over and over, assuming that certain parameters (conditions) are met.

How did you use a while loop, boolean, and counter in your guessing game? 
I used a while loop to keep my game going over and over again as long as the user wants, a boolean to determine whether to continue the while loop,
and a counter to count the number of tries.
