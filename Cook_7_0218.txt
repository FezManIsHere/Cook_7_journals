Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

This code sets the different pictures in the spritesheet for the "up" animation

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
It would be unrealistic / unproductive because we don't even use Slick for everything, but we need to know is how to implemet other things,
like arrays and arraylists, things we WILL need for everything.

What is an array?
A way to store multiple variables of a certain datatype.

How do you make an array? Give an example.
You make an array by doing something like:
String [] newstrings = {"me", "you", "him", "her"};

What is an ArrayList?
An ArrayList is like an array, but you can change the size of it later on.

How do you make an arraylist?
ArrayList<Integer> aList = new ArrayList<>();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
1. add()
2. isEmpty()
3. remove()

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
Arrays cannot have the amount of values possible changed later on. ArrayLists can.

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
We could make a health counter by having an array that tells the player their health status. For example, a string array with values of "damaged",
"critically damaged", "full health", or "above full health".
