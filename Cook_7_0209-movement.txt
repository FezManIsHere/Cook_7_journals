How can / will you make the orb move in the direction you are facing?
Explain and provide specific code.
I will do it using the examble code given on the journal page for my main code (not class main, but the old unwavering class) and then add in
more to move the orb depending on the direction of the player when the orb is launched.
Something like:
if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.right) {
   magic8ball.xmove = 10;
   magic8ball.ymove = 0;
} else if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.left) {
   magic8ball.xmove = -10;
   magic8ball.ymove = 0;
} else if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.up) {
   magic8ball.xmove = 0;
   magic8ball.ymove = -10;
} else if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.down) {
   magic8ball.xmove = 0;
   magic8ball.ymove = 10;
}
