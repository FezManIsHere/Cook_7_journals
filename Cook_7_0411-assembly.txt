What is assembly?
Assembly is a low-level programming language.

What is it good for?
It only contains code that is necessary to perform the given task, and it gives direct and complete control over system hardware.

How is assembly different than Java?
It is more difficult to learn, and is less portable. However, it is more efficient in terms of system resources.

What are differences between high level and low level languages?
High level languages are portable, faster to develop, has fewer lines of code, has easier maintenance, and the compiler translates to the target
machine language, and the low level languages are closer to machine languages, so they are more difficult to code but easier to compile.

Which type is Java? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of that language type?
Java is a high-level language. I know because of how close it is to english as we know it, and because of that, easier to code and maintain. It also
is portable. Many Java games run off of Windows AND Linux AND Mac OS.

Which type is Assembly? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of that language type?
Assembly is a low-level language. It resembles machine language, so it is harder to code/understand/maintenance, but is easier to compile.
