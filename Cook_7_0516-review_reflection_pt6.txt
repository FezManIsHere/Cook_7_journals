Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Casting is changing dataypes. It can become more or less complex, depending what you need. You can cast ints to doubles, doubles to ints, chars to
string, and so on.

Give a specific code example for up-casting
int mine = 2;
double yours;
yours = mine; //changing int to a double

Give a specific code example for down-casting
double bob = 3.14159;
int i;
i = (int)bob;

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
char b = 'b';
String s = ""+ b;

What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127. This is because it is a byte is 8 bits, each bit a binary number. The maximum value a byte can have is 11111111 (255) and having negative
values means there is a two's complement. This makes the numbers easier to identify, and the system doesn't have to worry about positive zero and
negative zero, just zero. 128 negative numbers + 127 positive numbers + 0 = 255.
