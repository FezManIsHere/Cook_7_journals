We will have an end of the year assessment.
What are 10 concepts you believe will be covered on the test. Why?
1. OOP (object oriented programming was an important philosophy when coding in Java)
2. Assembly (knowing the concept of high-level vs low-level is something we discussed for a while)
3. C (we have spent quite a bit of time coding with it to make our arduinos do stuff)
4. Arrays/ArrayLists (allowed us to make inventories/backpacks as well as blocked)
5. Classes (we spent a lot of time learning about what these are for, and used a lot of them)
6. Encapsulation (knowing the point of seperating code into classes (encapsulating it))
7. Objects (how they are used and created)
8. Declaration and Instantiation (knowing about the creation and use of variables and objects)
9. Getters and Setters (being able to change and read variables about objects from the mold of a class)
10. Class constructors (Knowing about how they are used to create objects with set variables from a class)
