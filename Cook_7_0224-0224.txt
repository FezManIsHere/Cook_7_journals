Define a class Rat
public class Rat {
}

Provide the code to declare and instatiate Rats
public static Rat splinter, leonardo, michaelangelo, donatello, raphael;

splinter = new Rat(20, 20);
leonardo = new Rat(30, 30);
michaelangelo = new Rat(35, 35);
donatello = new Rat(40, 40);
raphael = new Rat(45, 45);

They are placed in the main game code, that was once called Unwavering.

Provide a two-dimensional array that specifies coordinates for five rats
public static int[][] coordinates = new int {20,30,35,40,45}{20,30,35,40,45};
