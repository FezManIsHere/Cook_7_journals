In your game, what challenges must your player solve?
They must solve cryptic questions/random statements, getting an answere out of them.

How will you specifically track whether they have been solved?
I will just keep the user moving down a waterfall code pattern (always moving on in the plot).

Provide variable names and types. Classes if applicable. 
I have a scanner named scan and a string named answer.
