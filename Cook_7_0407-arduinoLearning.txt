Please describe 3 very specific things you have learned about CS or CS specific problems you have solved working with Arduino.
You should provide AT LEAST 9 sentences worth of detail.
I have learned the value of self evaluation/troubleshooting. These tools are excellent when we are encountering aproblem with a device/system we
aren't familiar with. Troubleshooting and all that pertains to it (raging, google, more raging, help from Mr. Davis) is a very valuable skill that shows
a sense of problem solving and maturity.

I have also learned that listening to my partner is key. I mean, he isn't gonna stop pestering about creating methods until you do, so you might
as well listen and get it over with. It will get the focus away from small insignificant arguments and move on to the main idea of the project.
They might also have, you know, decent ideas.

A final lesson I have learned is to not code in languages that you aren't fluent in. Writing numbered code in german isn't very smart when you take
longer that 5 seconds to remember the spelling of the numbers. It might not be as fun, but stick to a language that you can reliably use and
understand.
