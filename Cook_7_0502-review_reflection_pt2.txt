In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten about. These will all be tested on the final exam!
What is an array?
An array it a storage compartment for different variables of the same datatype.

How does one make a simple array of Strings?
String [] playerstring = {"Orb", "Enemy", "TreasureChest"};

What is the syntax for a 2-D array?
char[][] twodarray = new char[15][15];

What is the syntax for a 3-D array?
char[][][] threedarray = new char[6][6][6];

How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]
playerstring[2] = "Statue";

What is the syntax for a while loop?
while (true){
	int i = 0;
	i++;
}

Why use while loops in your game?
To allow a game to keep going until a condition is met.

Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
You just call the method. Something like bestGameEvuurr(); would work.

Why was it recommended that you use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input?
To keep the game from being case sensitive. If the game is case-sensitive, then it doesn't accept as many character inputs, making the player jump
through more loops to play the game than is necessary.

You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections. How? Why?
You do it to make everything neat and easy to identify when a problem arises. You can do this by making a method like 
static void checkForBad(String a, String b) {
	if (a.equals(b)){
	play = false;
	}
}
and then
checkforbad();
in the game method.
What values will you pass across methods? how? why?
I will pass the coordinate values in Strings. This makes it, in myopinio, easier because then you just send one value for both x and y instead of
one for each. I would send it like:
checkForBad(playercoords, enemycoords);
