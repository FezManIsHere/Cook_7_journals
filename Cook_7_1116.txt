No, really, How will you use methods in your game? Why?
Be specific.
What values will you pass to them?

I have three methods: intro, rules, and game. Intro introduces you to the game. It also has a warning. Rules contains rules to help you get your
syntax and thinking working well. And game has the actual content of the game. Since my game doesn't keep track of health, items, or anything like
that, I don't have to pass values to them. My game is a straightfoward text-based adventure, and is simple. It doesn't have a lot of complex
variables. It is basically a bunch of nested if statements. But hey, the simpler, the better. It is also a VERY hard game, so by the time you beat
it I'll have moved on to CS AP anyway.
