Why did Steve Ballmer call the GPL a virus?
He called it a virus because to him it attaches itself to everything it touches in an intellectual-property way.

What is the relationship/difference between open source and proprietary software?
Open source software can be changed modified, and freely used for any reason without copyright issues but proprietary software
reserves all rights and freedoms and you can't change or redistribute the program.

What are the differences between the GPL and MIT license?
The MIT license allows you to not have to make your proprietary code open source. You can encrypt the code or whatever, as long as
the MIT license notice is part of it. Meanwhile, the GPL requires that all software that you develop and distribute must give all
users the same rights as you, selling, modify, distribute, and your proprietary code is no longer proprietary, it has to be open source.
