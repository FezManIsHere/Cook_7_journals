You should be almost done with your methods.
Are you? Why or why not?
Yes...well, depending on what you call methods.

This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
I was thinking that those would save me time. However, considering most of the code that I have came from the last project, I didn't have to stress
over it. I was mainly thinking about how to improve my work during that time.

Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
Yes I did, because I was looking for help and I saw that. It was somewhat helpful but, meh, not really what I was looking for.

Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
No, because I didn't know that there was some there. I'm a smart one.

Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
static void drawSquares(int x, int y, GraphicsContext gc){
	int realx = 0;
	int realy = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
	gc.fillColor(Color.RED);
	gc.fillRect(realx, realy, 10, 10);
	realx++;
	realy++;
	}
}
